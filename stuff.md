# Enterprise design thinking

- It is a process used for creative problem solving and innovation.
- Generally design thinking has the end user at the core of all decision making, to go beyond the product itself and provide solutions to the users wants and needs.
  - However, _Enterprise_ design thinking also considers factors that businesses needs to succeed.
  - EDT lets businesses to innovate faster, stay ahead of competition, and minimize uncertainty and risks

## What is it?

- Developed and used by IBM (now used commonly in industry) to help diverese teams to collaborate on a larger enterprise level projects.
- Still focused on user outcomes, to understand, explore, prototype, and validate ideas with end users.

## The 3 principles

EDT is rooted in these three principles in order to quickly deliver solutions to meet and exceed customer expectations.

1. Focus on user outcomes

   - Just like traditional design thinkings, focus on users' needs
   - Create user personas to define the users and the problems they face, and improvements they want.
   - !! Analyse how the user experience affects bussiness problems, such as _revenue and customer retention_

2. Restless Reinvention

   - Rapdily prototype to validate ideas quickly
   - Get feedback, learn and improve
   - Course correcting with business needs in consideration

3. Diverse empowered teams
   - Working with varying perspectives and skills brings fresh and good ideas.
   - All steps in the design process are better with a diverse team.

## The Loop

IBM belives that design process is a repeating loop.

1. Oberve, the the world, the market, the users, the competitors, your products etc
2. Reflect, using learnings from observations to determine the next step
3. Make. Execute the idea and validate with user.
   Repeat the loop faster to innovate faster.

## The Keys

Using these "keys" helps teams to produce products from ideas, while helping diverse teams to stay aligned.

1. Hills. Targets based on user outcomes, instead of features.

   - Each hill is an ideal end state for users.
   - Used to define scope and objective of the project.
   - IBM recommends for project no more than 3 major release "hills"

2. Playbacks. Something about coporate lang, this is my understanding

   - In order to collect lots of a feedback, teams can organize "playbacks".
   - Design user-centric sessions to evaluate how previous "hills" meets user objectives.
   - Basically review previous work to demonstrate progress and ensure quality of product.

3. Sponsor users.
   - Real people selected from the real or intended user group.
   - Work with Sponsor Users to obtain a more realistic sense of user's requirements
     - In business, do not guess what the client wants.
   - Work with them through the entire process of the product's development.

## How to apply EDT in your project?

1. Define problem in a user centric way
2. Include diverse team members and teams at all stages.
3. Validate ideas with real user, real people.
4. Measure progress by how well user needs and wants are being fulfilled.
5. Treat everything as a prototype on constantly improve.
6. Remember to build to serve user needs, not just build for the sake of new products and features.
